# Hi, I'm Laura Manuela! ðŸ‘‹

### ðŸš€ About Me
I'm currently completing a **DiplÃ´me d'ingÃ©nieur** in France, with a specialization in **Artificial Intelligence** and **Computer Vision**. My academic background has equipped me with strong technical skills in **machine learning**, **image processing**, and **large language models (LLMs)**, with a wide range of applications across various industries. I'm particularly fascinated by the applications of these technologies in **astronomy** and **astrophysics**.

### ðŸŽ¯ My Academic Focus
- **Artificial Intelligence (AI)**: Designing intelligent systems that can learn, adapt, and make decisions.
- **Computer Vision**: Developing algorithms for image analysis, object detection, and scene understanding.
- **Remote Sensing**: I'm particularly interested in how satellite imagery and data can be leveraged to study and monitor environmental changes, natural disasters, and land use.

### ðŸŒŸ What Iâ€™m Looking For
Right now, I'm looking for an **end-of-studies internship** in the fields of **remote sensing**, **AI**, **computer vision** or **natural language processing (NLP)**. I'm particularly interested in roles where I can apply my skills and continue learning about building intelligent systems that can interpret and analyze visual or textual data.
